# Advancing-Interpretability-in-Sequential-Models-through-Generative-AI-Rationalization-Using-GPT-4
Repository for 'Advancing Interpretability in Sequential Models using GPT-4'. Enhances AI transparency by integrating GPT-4 for generating explainable predictions in NLP. Includes model training, data preprocessing, and rationale generation scripts.


# Advancing Interpretability in Sequential Models using GPT-4
# Project Overview
This repository hosts the implementation of a hybrid AI model that leverages GPT-4 to enhance interpretability in sequential prediction systems within NLP. It aims to provide detailed, understandable explanations of model decisions, bridging the gap between AI outputs and human comprehension.

# Key Features
Context-Sensitive Rationale Generation: Uses GPT-4 to generate explanations for predictions.
Data Preprocessing Scripts: Prepare your data for training with bespoke methods.
Model Training and Evaluation: Scripts to train the model and evaluate its performance using standard metrics.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.6+ and pip installed on your system.

# Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:

#bash
//Copy code
#git clone https://github.com/MohdRasol/Advancing-Interpretability-in-Sequential-Models-through-Generative-AI-Rationalization-Using-GPT-4.git
#cd advancing-interpretability-using-gpt4
#pip install -r requirements.txt
//Running the Model
//To start training the model with default parameters:

#bash
//Copy code
#python train_model.py
//To generate rationales using a pre-trained model:

#bash
//Copy code
#python generate_rationale.py
//Usage
//Detailed usage instructions and examples can be found in the docs folder. This includes scripts for preprocessing data, training the model, and generating rationales.
